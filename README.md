## Contributing
## Fork the repo.

* Currently there are no tests, and I would love if people were to create some.

* myTA is very bare bones and any contributions will be very appreciated

* Try to dd a test for your change. Refactoring and documentation changes do not need new tests.

* Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

## Syntax:

* Two spaces, no tabs.
* No trailing whitespace. Blank lines should not have any space.
* Prefer &&, || over and, or.
* MyClass.my_method(my_arg) not my_method( my_arg ) or my_method my_arg.
* a = b and not a=b.
* Follow the conventions you see used in the source already.
